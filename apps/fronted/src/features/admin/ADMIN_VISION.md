What we do now:

## Rearrange admin app that way:

I see it in three window or steps:
first: - upload file from local storage to the server hopper;

second: - select right files by #tags, techniques or any other catalog unit property and see them in one window in preview mode - selection criteria can be changed at any moment by admin;

third: - drag and drop to block window, where block type and layout is selected - add necessary improvements to the block watching exactly what will be displayed later on the stream.

1. ### Upload new artworks to hopper
   - This feature allows admin upload new file/files from his local computer to on server hopper folder
2. ### Add new artworks to catalog:

   - admin should see all available images to add to catalog (from some income hopper as original full size png images )
   - admin should have option to add image from hopper to catalog:
   - open art item info window with default values to fill
   - then have all appropriate data entered by one click:
     - make and save all kind of preview images;
     - resize (if necessary after check ) fullsize image and save it to vault
     - create complete record in catalog.json

3. ### Create a block:

   - there has to be two windows:
     a. catalog window, where we have as previews all catalog items with important info floating upon the preview while hover and filter tools;
     b. block window, where we see block under creation as it will look on site with option to change;
     c. !! maybe block can have some personal name in addition to id;
     d. set of block can be saved (not as a stream) for future use;

4. ### Create stream from catalog files:
   - here we have to have to windows:
     - blocks window: where we see some set of blocks, as with a pictures as with a text;
     - stream window: where we see stream as to going to look on site;
     - admin should have ability to drag and drop block items from block window to the stream, having option to create text block on the fly;
   - if it's not very complicated I'd give admin option to see stream in small scale to be able estimate "helicopter view" an drag and drop block's order in the stream;
   - name and create stream file and bind it to the partition button on the main screen;

### P.S. Turned out 4 steps



*******************************************************************

## Fast API refactoring:
   1. Add new vault folders and routes to handle with its files. ??? 
      **Wouldn't it reduce routers and use parameters to cover all needs?**
   2.
